#AICamera

#Project Description:

AICamera is a Flask-based Python application designed for real-time video streaming with advanced AI features. Utilizing Movenet from TensorFlow and OpenCV, this app provides robust motion detection and analysis capabilities. Built within a Conda container for easy setup and deployment, AICamera supports a wide range of RTSP IP cameras and offers enhanced streaming performance with UDP and multithreading.

#Features:

Real-time Video Streaming: Stream video feeds in real-time from any RTSP IP camera.
AI-Powered Motion Detection: Leverage TensorFlow's Movenet for precise motion detection and analysis.
High Performance: Utilize UDP for faster streaming and multithreading to handle multiple video streams efficiently.
Flexible Camera Support: Compatible with Hikvision cameras and any other RTSP IP cameras.
Easy Deployment: Packaged in a Conda container for seamless installation and setup.

#Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
Flask
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Conda
Hikvision or any other RTSP IP camera

#Future:

To implement a supervised learning approach for detecting and handling faulty detections.So on every detection the user can choose if the detection was faulty,training the algorithm to avoid faulty detections on different type of rooms and furniture alignment
